Lab 1: Basic Device Connectivity

Objective
To configure two PCs and a switch, assign IP addresses, test connectivity, and verify successful communication using ping.

Topology

PC1 ---- Switch ---- PC2

IP Addressing Table

| Device | IP Address     | Subnet Mask     |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| PC1    | 192.168.1.10   | 255.255.255.0   |
| PC2    | 192.168.1.20   | 255.255.255.0   |

Steps

1. Add two PCs and one switch in Packet Tracer.
2. Connect PC1 and PC2 to the switch using Copper Straight-Through cables.
3. Assign the IP addresses to each PC.
4. Test connectivity using the `ping` command.
5. Document whether communication was successful.

Results
Both PCs should successfully ping each other, confirming proper basic network configuration.

 Notes
This foundational lab strengthens understanding of:
- Basic addressing
- Connectivity testing
- Switch operation
